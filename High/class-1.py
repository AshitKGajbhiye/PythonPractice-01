'''
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: My class.Myattribute
__init__() method
The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
The self keyword in Python is used to represent an instance (object) of a class. It allows you to access attributes and methods of the class in Python. It must be the first parameter of any method in the class, including the __init__ method, which is the constructor.

        self.name = name

    # Sample Method
    def say_hi(self):
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)
