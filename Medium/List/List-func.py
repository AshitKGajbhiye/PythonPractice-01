extend(): Adds multiple elements to a list.
index(): Returns the first appearance of the specified value.
max(list): It returns an item from the list with max value.
min(list): It returns an item from the list with min value.
len(list): It gives the total length of the list.
list(seq): Converts a tuple into a list.
cmp(list1, list2): It compares elements of both lists list1 and list2.

Functions Of Dictionary
clear(): Removes all the elements from the dictionary
copy(): Returns a copy of the dictionary
fromkeys(): Returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value
get(): Returns the value of the specified key
items(): Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair
keys(): Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys
pop(): Removes the element with the specified key
popitem(): Removes the last inserted key-value pair
setdefault(): Returns the value of the specified key. If the key does not exist: insert the key, with the specified value
update(): Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs

Functions Of Tuple
cmp(tuple1, tuple2) - Compares elements of both tuples.
len(): total length of the tuple.
max(): Returns item from the tuple with max value.
min(): Returns item from the tuple with min value.
tuple(seq): Converts a list into tuple.
sum(): returns the arithmetic sum of all the items in the tuple.
any(): If even one item in the tuple has a Boolean value of True, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
all(): returns True only if all items have a Boolean value of True. Otherwise, it returns False.
