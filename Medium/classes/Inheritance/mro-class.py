'''Method Resolution Order is the sequence in which Python looks for a method in a hierarchy of classes. Especially in the context of multiple inheritances, where a class is derived from more than one base class, MRO becomes crucial to understand which method is actually being called.

Understanding MRO is critical in Python programming because it helps in debugging and reading code effectively. Knowing the order in which methods are resolved helps in predicting the behavior of your code, especially in complex class hierarchies.'''
class Base:
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from Base"

class First(Base):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from First"

class Second(Base):
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from Second"

class Third(First, Second):
    pass

third_obj = Third()
print(third_obj.greet())  # Output: Hello from First
print(Third.__mro__)

# (<class '__main__.Third'>, <class '__main__.First'>, <class '__main__.Second'>, <class '__main__.Base'>, <class 'object'>)
